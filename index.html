        <p>
          I'm an energetic software engineer who's eager to learn, grow and
          evolve. I’m charismatic and very naturally proficient at building and
          maintaining strong professional relationships. A visionary with
          astronomically impactful long term goals. Great critical thinking and
          problem-solving skills. I thrive in a team environment and I'm
          dedicated to completing the tasks at hand and to the overarching
          vision of the project.

            <p>
              <span>**Under Construction**</span> A mock health insurance app for practice for a startup idea I had.
              It is a browser-based app made with Python/Django and Python, with
              full CRUD capability. When fully developed, it will allow
              customers to cover their entire immediate families with great
              health insurance.

            >
            <p>
              A full-stack app that was created by a team of developers using
              HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, Axios, and React.js on the front end,
              and Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Axios, and Heroku on
              the back end. The app lets users search an extensive database of
              movies, and organize them into categories of their choosing. Once
              organized, the user can then view the trailers for their movies
              and decide whether or not they want to see them. The front end was
              deployed with Github Pages and the back end was deployed with
              Heroku.

            <a href="">Hack Overflow</a>
            <p>
              A simple remake of Stack Overflow that was created using HTML 5,
              CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js,
              Handlebars.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to give it full CRUD
              capability. Users can ask questions about software problems and
              leave their prospective answers, and correct other users’ answers.
              Deployed with Heroku.

            <a href="">Pharmacy Flash Cards</a>
            <p>
              Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As a certified pharmacy
              technician for six years, the easiest way for aspiring and new
              technicians to learn to decipher doctor's handwriting and the
              brand and generic names of drugs is to use flash-cards. I decided
              to make a simple flash-card game similar to what I did in the
              past.
